=head1 NAME

OPENSSL_s390xcap - the z processor capabilities vector

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 env OPENSSL_s390xcap=... <application>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

libcrypto supports z architecture instruction set extensions. These
extensions are denoted by individual bits in the capability vector.
When libcrypto is initialized, the bits returned by the STFLE instruction
and by the QUERY functions are stored in the vector.

To change the set of instructions available to an application, you can
set the OPENSSL_s390xcap environment variable before you start the
application. After initialization, the capability vector is ANDed bitwise
with the corresponding parts of the environment variable.

OPENSSL_s390xcap is a colon-separated list of 64-bit values in
hexadecimal notation. The 0x prefix is optional. Prefix a value with a
tilde (~) to denote a bitwise NOT operation. A point indicates the end
of the STFLE bits and the beginning of the QUERY bits, respectively.

The environment variable has the following structure:

STFLE:STFLE:STFLE.KIMD:KIMD:KM:KM:KMC:KMC:KMAC:KMAC:KMCTR:KMCTR:KMO:KMO
:KMF:KMF:PRNO:PRNO:KMA:KMA

The following bits are significant:

=head1 EXAMPLES

OPENSSL_s390xcap=::~0x4000000000000000 disables the vector facility.

OPENSSL_s390xcap=.0:0 disables KIMD.

OPENSSL_s390xcap=.::~0x2800 disables KM-XTS-AES.
